        <h3>About Education</h3>
        <p class="p-bio">
          The first university started in 1088 with the launch of the University
          of Bologna and evolved until the 18th century to what we know today,
          the modern model of schools and universities. <br />
          Since then, nothing has changed in this model, despite of a completed
          changed landscape. <br /><br>
          A teacher, sometime an expert, is talking to a lot of students who are
          passively attending their classes, sitting for hours, learning by
          heart things that they will forget as soon as the exam is done. And
          for this, you get a degree, that most of the time will be useless in
          your long-term career. This leads to this sad truth: only 150 of 3500
          U.S. Colleges are worth the investment. <br /><br>
          The context though has changed a lot. Internet came into our lives,
          and it changed everything: it’s global, instantaneous, connected, and
          it’s always with us — in our pocket (smartphone). <br /><br>
          So that means that you don’t need to be at the same place, at the same
          time to hear somebody speak. You don’t need to travel to another
          country anymore to read a specific book which only this library has a
          copy of. The information is here, whenever you want, wherever you
          want. <br />
          In seconds, you can now have access to anything you want to learn. In
          fact there is so much information, that this is becoming the new
          challenge of education. <br />
          Education is no longer about access to information, but being able to
          learn how to find the right information. <br />
          <br />
          What also changed so much is the pace the world is going. Everything
          is going faster and faster — and this increasingly fast pace is today
          driven by technology. And this brings another challenge, because
          really, <br />
          <blockquote>"we don’t know what the Future is going to be and what the jobs are going to be in 10 years from now"</blockquote> <br>
          <p class="p-bio">we don’t know what the Future is going to be and what the jobs are going to be in 10 years from now. If you think about what our kids learn in high school, or college, it will probably be outdated before you graduate. So this brings another challenge, how do we make sure that we teach our students the theory and tools that are going to be useful in 10 years? <br>
          <strong>The answer is we don’t, because we can’t.</strong> most of the jobs of the Future don’t exist yet. What we need to teach our children is how to learn, how to learn fast and efficiently, in a world where there is too much information accessible to us, and in a world where they will have to have multiple jobs and multiple careers.</p> <br>
